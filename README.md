## Environment Variable Management

This repository uses the NPM package `@chainlink/env-enc` to keep private keys, RPC URLs, and other secrets encrypted at rest. This helps reduce the risk of leaking your private key.

By default, the `@chainlink/env-enc` package will store your encrypted environment variables in a file named `.env.enc` in the root directory of this repository. Ensure that your .gitignore file includes`.env.enc`

### Usage

Set the encryption password by running the command

```
npx env-enc set-pw
```

Set a new environment variable by running the command

```
npx env-enc set
```

See all your currently set environment variables

```
npx env-enc view
```

Remove an environment variable

```
npx env-enc remove SOME_ENV_VAR_NAME
```

## Hardhat Guide

- `hardhat.config.ts` specifies the settings like imports, networks, solidity verions, etc that will all be made available through the hre (hardhat runtime environment)

### Scripts

- good for executing code that doesnt require parameters

```
yarn hardhat run scripts/<path-to-script>
```

### Tasks

- good for executing scripts that require parameters passed on the command line
- not allowed to import hre into scripts that are imported and used by tasks

```
yarn hardhat <task-name> <task-params>
```
